## ðŸ§© What is MCP Server?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an open standard designed by OpenAI to connect AI models (like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot) with external tools, data, and services in a secure and structured way.

### Key Concepts
- **MCP Server:** A local or remote service that exposes capabilities (APIs, data, or automation) that AI tools can use.
- **MCP Client:** The interface (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, VS Code) that communicates with the MCP Server.
- **Protocol Layer:** Ensures structured, secure interaction between AI and your environment.

### Why MCP?
- Enables **AI-driven automation** using existing DevOps tools.
- Standardizes integration between **LLMs and infrastructure-as-code** tools.
- Brings **context awareness** and **secure execution boundaries** to AI workflows.
