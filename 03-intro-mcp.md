## 🛠️ Introduction to `mcp-server-terraform`

**`mcp-server-terraform`** bridges AI tools and Terraform CLI.
It allows GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT (with MCP support) to:
- Create, plan, and apply Terraform configurations
- Generate `.tf` code on demand
- Manage state securely
- Automate infrastructure deployment workflows

### Benefits
- **Natural language IaC**: Ask Copilot to “create a VPC in AWS” and it writes Terraform code.
- **Reusable Environments**: MCP handles state and workspace setup.
- **Integration Ready**: Works well with GitHub Actions, VS Code, and local Terraform CLI.
